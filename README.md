## Why Hertanate
Donating should be simple and meaningful, but in reality, itâ€™s often full of friction. Users rarely know where their money actually goes, and sometimes, the creators or people they donate to donâ€™t even realize someone contributed. For first-time donorsâ€”especially with cryptoâ€”the process can be confusing, filled with technical steps like setting up wallets and choosing the right network. On top of that, most platforms require users to create an account, verify their email, and go through several steps before they can donate. All of this complexity ends up getting in the way of good intentions.

**Hertanate removes the barriers between people and making donations as easy as connecting your wallet**
